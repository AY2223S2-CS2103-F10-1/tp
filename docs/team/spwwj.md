### Project: OfficeConnect

OfficeConnect is a task management tool designed specifically for managerial role personnel at companies. The target users are individuals who are responsible for assigning tasks and overseeing the work of a team.

The product addresses several challenges faced by managers in the current office environment, such as work overload
among subordinates, difficulties in coordinating tasks with a large number of employees, and time-consuming manual tasks
like typing and sending emails.

OfficeConnect offers a solution to these problems by providing better visibility into subordinates' workloads, allowing
managers to efficiently delegate tasks in an organised manner.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

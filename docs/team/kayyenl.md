### Project: OfficeConnect

OfficeConnect is a task management tool designed specifically for managerial role personnel at companies. The target users are individuals who are responsible for assigning tasks and overseeing the work of a team.

The product addresses several challenges faced by managers in the current office environment, such as work overload among subordinates, difficulties in coordinating tasks with a large number of employees, and time-consuming manual tasks like typing and sending emails.

OfficeConnect offers a solution to these problems by providing better visibility into subordinates' workloads, allowing managers to efficiently delegate tasks in an organised manner. The app also automates the process of planning and communicating with subordinates, making it easier for managers to get things done. Additionally, the app ensures that emails are sent during working hours, so that subordinates will not be disturbed outside of work.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Enhancement to Existing Feature**: **Advanced Help Window**

  * What it does: Allows the user view help for each individual command that can be entered into OfficeConnect.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience when he/she requires help. It removes the need to go online to search through extensive versions of User Guides to inform them of what commands they should input.
  * Highlights: This enhancement gives the user a bird's eye view of the ways a command can be used in a digestable (tree-view, hierarchical like arrangements of commands) that is easy to refer to.

* **New Feature**: **Quickstart Guide**

  * What it does: Gives the user a simple and brief initial run-through of the OfficeConnect app.
  * Justification: As the very first experience a user has with OfficeConnect is likely to be the one with the highest learning curve, we ensure that the user is brought to speed with the **Quickstart Guide**. The guide provides non-verbose, easy to follow images of the actual UI to point out crucial parts of the OfficeConnect App, making sure that the user learns how to make use of OfficeConnect's basic functions without being overloaded with information.
  * Highlights: Concise instructions given by the help of easy-to-follow pictures of the actual OfficeConnect's different components to improve the user's initial experience with OfficeConnect.

OfficeConnect is a task management tool designed specifically for managerial role personnels based in Singapore.

As managers in the current office environment, it is often not easy to grasp the workload of subordinates. This may result in:
* work overload among subordinates
* difficulties in coordinating tasks with a large number of employees
* inefficient, time-consuming administrative tasks like typing and sending emails.

OfficeConnect offers a solution to these problems by providing better visibility into subordinatesâ€™ workloads, allowing
managers to efficiently delegate tasks in an organised manner.

## 2. Tutorial

Welcome to OfficeConnect! 

This section is designed specifically for newcomers like you who are looking to get started with our platform. 
Here, you'll find all the essential information you need to start using OfficeConnect and make the most out of 
its features.

So without any further ado, let's dive in!

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
OfficeConnect comes with preloaded data that aims to help you get familiar with the platform when you first launch it.
</div>

Let's first look at how you can add a new employee's contact to OfficeConnect. Enter this into the command line: <br> 
`addp n/Johnny Ackles p/95967755 e/jensona@example.com a/Mary Streeth #01-01`. <br>
This command adds a person named `Johnny Ackles` who lives at `Mary Streeth #01-01` whose phone number is `95967755`
and email address is`jensona@example.com`. If you scroll down on the contact list, you will see that the new contact is
added.
![add_whitebackground.jpg](images%2Fproduct-screenshots%2Fadd_whitebackground.jpg)
<p align="center">
<em>New contact added!</em>
</p><br/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
With OfficeConnect, you can experience a real-time search functionality where the search results update dynamically
as you type into the input field.
</div>

Suppose now you want to find Alice's details and her assigned task. Simply type `find Alice` and you
should be able to see the list being updated as such:
![find_whitebackground.jpg](images%2Fproduct-screenshots%2Ffind_whitebackground.jpg)
<p align="center">
<em>Alice found not slacking;)</em>
</p><br/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You may notice that there are progress bars of different 
   <span style="color:red">**c**</span><span style="color:orange">**o**</span><span style="color:yellow">**l**</span><span style="color:green">**o**</span><span style="color:blue">**r**</span><span style="color:violet">**s**</span> within each task. Let's look at what each color means! Let's see an example with all the different types of progress bars below. <br>
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99934242/230615373-609f3ec9-fca3-48e9-bbb2-ce1c8d7b048f.png)
<br>
<br>The <span style="color:green">**green**</span> colored progress bar indicates that the task is done, and before the deadline.
<br>The <span style="color:red">**red**</span> colored progress bar indicates that the task is undone, and that the deadline has passed.
<br>The <span style="color:blue">**blue**</span> colored progress bar indicates that the task is undone, but the deadline has not passed.
</div>

If you find yourself forgetting some commands over time, there's no need to worry. Memory leak happens to the best of 
us. You can simply access the help menu using a simple command: `help` to refresh your memory or even 
learn more about new features.

## 3. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:** <br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. Refer to the [[Prefix](#12-prefixes-used-in-commands)] section to recap the meaning of these parameters and how they should be used!<br>
  e.g. in `addp n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addp n/John Doe`.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional, while those not in square brackets are compulsory.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe tag/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* For any command, all prefixes of **optional AND compulsory** parameters cannot be used as an input in **ANY** parameter of the **same** command.<br>
  e.g In `addt t/TITLE c/CONTENT st/STATUS [dl/DEADLINE]`, `CONTENT` cannot be `c/complete presentation t/by today` as **t/** is a prefix of a parameter.

* Items with `â€¦` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[tag/TAG]â€¦` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `tag/friend`, `tag/friend tag/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `listp`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* For specific constraints of each parameter, refer back to the [[Prefix]((#12-prefixes-used-in-commands))] section.

* To differentiate between commands intended for a specific person or task, a tag (-t or -p) is added to the end of the keyword.

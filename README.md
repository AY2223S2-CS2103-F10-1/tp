* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `AddressBook Level 3` (`AB3` for short) because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.


OfficeConnect is a task management tool designed specifically for managerial role personnel at companies. The target users are individuals who are responsible for assigning tasks and overseeing the work of a team.

The product addresses several challenges faced by managers in the current office environment, such as work overload among subordinates, difficulties in coordinating tasks with a large number of employees, and time-consuming manual tasks like typing and sending emails.

OfficeConnect offers a solution to these problems by providing better visibility into subordinates' workloads, allowing managers to efficiently delegate tasks in an organized manner. The app also automates the process of planning and communicating with subordinates, making it easier for managers to get things done. Additionally, the app ensures that emails are sent during working hours, so that subordinates will not be disturbed outside of work.
